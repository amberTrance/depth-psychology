## Symbolic interpretation

This project was built with two purposes in mind: to learn node.js and to build my own app in which
I can store symbols and their meaning, as found in various books. Since this app is private, you will
see that there is a login system but no registration. The login gives me access to pages in which I
can add data to the db.
